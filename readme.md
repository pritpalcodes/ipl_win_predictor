## Project Inspiration 

Inspired by the transformative power of data analytics as depicted in the movie "MONEYBALL," we embarked on a journey to redefine the face of cricket. This project draws inspiration from the concept of data-driven decision-making in sports, aiming to predict the outcome of IPL cricket matches by leveraging advanced data analysis.

## Project Overview

This is an end-to-end machine learning project that assesses the probability of an IPL cricket team winning a match at any given moment. The prediction is grounded in several critical factors, including the target score, stadium conditions, current run rate, overs played, available wickets, and the performance of the competing teams. Unlike traditional approaches that prioritize high model accuracy, this project rigorously follows a comprehensive Machine Learning Development Life Cycle.

## Project Phases 

#### 1. Problem Framing 
The primary objective is to forecast the win probability of an IPL match after the second innings. Key factors considered are the stadium, target score, current run rate, required run rate, batsmen on the crease, and the battling teams.

#### 2. Data Gathering 
We've sourced our dataset from Kaggle, encompassing complete IPL match data up to the 2019 season.

#### 3. Data Preparation 
Our dataset is remarkably clean and well-organized, with no missing or empty values, rendering it ready for in-depth analysis.

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
EDA helps unveil valuable insights within the data. This includes scrutinizing distributions, correlations, and other data patterns.

#### 5. Feature Engineering 
We meticulously cherry-pick the most pertinent columns, such as stadium, target score, current score, overs played, and wickets in hand, crucial for building the model.

#### 6. Model Training 
We select an appropriate machine learning model, divide the data into training and testing sets, and proceed to train the model. The model choice and training process are carefully aligned with the dataset's characteristics.

#### 7. Model Deployment
Our trained model finds a new home on Heroku, making it readily accessible to users for predicting match win probabilities.

#### 8. Testing 
Real-world data is used to test the deployed model, and its performance is rigorously evaluated to ensure that its predictions align with actual match outcomes.

#### 9. Backup and Optimization 
We implement robust backup strategies for the deployed model and embark on a journey of data refinement, load balancing, and model optimization.
